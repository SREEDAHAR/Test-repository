What is Micro Services?
 Independent deployable, Small Component
with out effecting other components.

Each one is an individual application
take things life is fast as much as more.

Micro Services Challenges:

1) Bounded Context
  MicroService1  --> MicroService2 -->MicroService3-->MicroService4 -->MicroService5 -->MicroService6

2)Configurarion ManageMent
    Multiple instances with different environments.
	
3) Dynamic Scale up and SCALE Down.
 Naming Server (EUREKHA)
 Ribbon (Client Side Load Balancing)
 Feign (Easier Rest Clients)
 
  Dynamic Load balancer with all instances of those services are able to stop and start with active instances.
 we also need to monitor those services, All these kind of things need to be auotmated

4) Pack of Cards  
   MicroService1  --> MicroService2 -->MicroService3-->MicroService4 -->MicroService5 -->MicroService6
5) Visibilty and Monitoring
    Zipkin Distributed Tracing
	Netflix API Gateway
	

Advantages of MicroServices

1) New Technology & Process Adoption
  Enable to adopt the new technologies adopt easily. 
MicroService1  --> MicroService2 -->MicroService3-->MicroService4 -->MicroService5 -->MicroService6 
2) Dynamic Scaling
3) Faster Release Cycles.

Microservices - Differences between Microservices and SOA
----------------------------------------------------------
MicroServices have similar goals of SOA : Create Services around your buisness logic.
   MicroService1  --> MicroService2 -->MicroService3-->MicroService4 -->MicroService5 -->MicroService6
